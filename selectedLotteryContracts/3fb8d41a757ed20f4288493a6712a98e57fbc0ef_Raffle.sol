/** ****************************************************************************
 * @notice Interface for contracts using VRF randomness
 * *****************************************************************************
 * @dev PURPOSE
 *
 * @dev Reggie the Random Oracle (not his real job) wants to provide randomness
 * @dev to Vera the verifier in such a way that Vera can be sure he's not
 * @dev making his output up to suit himself. Reggie provides Vera a public key
 * @dev to which he knows the secret key. Each time Vera provides a seed to
 * @dev Reggie, he gives back a value which is computed completely
 * @dev deterministically from the seed and the secret key.
 *
 * @dev Reggie provides a proof by which Vera can verify that the output was
 * @dev correctly computed once Reggie tells it to her, but without that proof,
 * @dev the output is indistinguishable to her from a uniform random sample
 * @dev from the output space.
 *
 * @dev The purpose of this contract is to make it easy for unrelated contracts
 * @dev to talk to Vera the verifier about the work Reggie is doing, to provide
 * @dev simple access to a verifiable source of randomness. It ensures 2 things:
 * @dev 1. The fulfillment came from the VRFCoordinator
 * @dev 2. The consumer contract implements fulfillRandomWords.
 * *****************************************************************************
 * @dev USAGE
 *
 * @dev Calling contracts must inherit from VRFConsumerBase, and can
 * @dev initialize VRFConsumerBase's attributes in their constructor as
 * @dev shown:
 *
 * @dev   contract VRFConsumer {
 * @dev     constructor(<other arguments>, address _vrfCoordinator, address _link)
 * @dev       VRFConsumerBase(_vrfCoordinator) public {
 * @dev         <initialization with other arguments goes here>
 * @dev       }
 * @dev   }
 *
 * @dev The oracle will have given you an ID for the VRF keypair they have
 * @dev committed to (let's call it keyHash). Create subscription, fund it
 * @dev and your consumer contract as a consumer of it (see VRFCoordinatorInterface
 * @dev subscription management functions).
 * @dev Call requestRandomWords(keyHash, subId, minimumRequestConfirmations,
 * @dev callbackGasLimit, numWords),
 * @dev see (VRFCoordinatorInterface for a description of the arguments).
 *
 * @dev Once the VRFCoordinator has received and validated the oracle's response
 * @dev to your request, it will call your contract's fulfillRandomWords method.
 *
 * @dev The randomness argument to fulfillRandomWords is a set of random words
 * @dev generated from your requestId and the blockHash of the request.
 *
 * @dev If your contract could have concurrent requests open, you can use the
 * @dev requestId returned from requestRandomWords to track which response is associated
 * @dev with which randomness request.
 * @dev See "SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS" for principles to keep in mind,
 * @dev if your contract could have multiple requests in flight simultaneously.
 *
 * @dev Colliding `requestId`s are cryptographically impossible as long as seeds
 * @dev differ.
 *
 * *****************************************************************************
 * @dev SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
 *
 * @dev A method with the ability to call your fulfillRandomness method directly
 * @dev could spoof a VRF response with any random value, so it's critical that
 * @dev it cannot be directly called by anything other than this base contract
 * @dev (specifically, by the VRFConsumerBase.rawFulfillRandomness method).
 *
 * @dev For your users to trust that your contract's random behavior is free
 * @dev from malicious interference, it's best if you can write it so that all
 * @dev behaviors implied by a VRF response are executed *during* your
 * @dev fulfillRandomness method. If your contract must store the response (or
 * @dev anything derived from it) and use it later, you must ensure that any
 * @dev user-significant behavior which depends on that stored value cannot be
 * @dev manipulated by a subsequent VRF request.
 *
 * @dev Similarly, both miners and the VRF oracle itself have some influence
 * @dev over the order in which VRF responses appear on the blockchain, so if
 * @dev your contract could have multiple VRF requests in flight simultaneously,
 * @dev you must ensure that the order in which the VRF responses arrive cannot
 * @dev be used to manipulate your contract's user-significant behavior.
 *
 * @dev Since the block hash of the block which contains the requestRandomness
 * @dev call is mixed into the input to the VRF *last*, a sufficiently powerful
 * @dev miner could, in principle, fork the blockchain to evict the block
 * @dev containing the request, forcing the request to be included in a
 * @dev different block with a different hash, and therefore a different input
 * @dev to the VRF. However, such an attack would incur a substantial economic
 * @dev cost. This cost scales with the number of blocks the VRF oracle waits
 * @dev until it calls responds to a request. It is for this reason that
 * @dev that you can signal to an oracle you'd like them to wait longer before
 * @dev responding to the request (however this is not enforced in the contract
 * @dev and so remains effective only in the case of unmodified oracle software).

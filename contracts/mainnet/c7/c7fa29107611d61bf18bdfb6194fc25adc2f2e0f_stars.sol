//    Taken on October 7, 2014 Falling Stars is the very first Ebb and Flow ever created that ended up in my portfolio. It is          //
//    a photo of direct light glistening off the windblown surface of Crater Lake, Oregon and aside from a crop, this image is         //
//    presented as photographed from the northeastern rim near Palisade Point.                                                         //
//                                                                                                                                     //
//    2014 was a pivotal year in my creative journey and photography career. I had taken a chance and applied for an                   //
//    Artist-in-Residency appointment at Crater Lake National Park. To my surprise, I was accepted into the program and spent          //
//    two weeks in the park, opting for October in the hopes that I would have a better chance of the weather systems moving           //
//    through and hopefully, the first snow of the year. The summers and early autumns in Oregon are dominated by mostly clear         //
//    skies and this can make for some challenging conditions and light to photograph in. The entire first week was nothing but        //
//    hot temperatures and cloudless skies. I was disheartened at first, as I let my hopes and expectations dictate my approach        //
//    and mindset, but the more time that I spent just sitting and observing, the more that I realized that beauty was                 //
//    everywhere around me– even in the seemingly mundane dirt, rocks, and water that make up the park. It wasn’t a change of          //
//    conditions that I needed, it was a change in mindset and approach. I needed to dig deeper and explore that beauty through        //
//    my camera to find solace and gratitude that I had the opportunity to exist right then and there and I needed to place the        //
//    value on the fact that I got to experience those moments. That switch of mentality is what made me the photographer I am         //
//    today and has played a crucial role in the work that I produce and the importance that it holds for me. I needed that            //
//    first week as a lesson and I was lucky enough to be blessed with the more favorable conditions I initially hoped for             //
//    during the second week of the residency when I was able to sit in solitude while watching low clouds pour over the rim of        //
//    the caldera and also experience the first snow of the year, which dropped a couple of inches in the park, completely             //
//    transforming it into a winter wonderland.                                                                                        //
//                                                                                                                                     //
//    Being a co-parent with a stressful and demanding full-time restaurant management job, I rarely had opportunities for             //
//    anything more than a day trip to escape to nature and fill my soul. This residency appointment was the first time that I         //
//    got to forget about work meetings and responsibilities and completely immerse myself in my creative pursuits. It was hard        //
//    for me to accept at first. The guilty burdening thoughts of being undeserving of this experience and that I should be back       //
//    in the city with my son or slaving away with my kitchen team were overwhelming, and I’m not sure I was ever able to get away     //
//    from them. Because of that I made sure to wring every bit of gratitude out of the experience and I still highly value my         //
//    time there, even all these years and dozens of visits later.                                                                     //
//                                                                                                                                     //
//    And I learned a few things too:                                                                                                  //
//                                                                                                                                     //
//    1. I learned that following my creative passion was something that I wanted to do full-time and I made it my goal to work        //
//    towards being a full-time photographer. I gave myself a 5 year timeframe to achieve this goal and exceeded that goal by          //
//    going full-time in October of 2017.                                                                                              //
//                                                                                                                                     //
//    2. It taught me that there is no such thing as bad light and that beautiful things can happen all day long. This mindset         //
//    completely shifted the way I approach photography and ever since this trip I have explored midday light with purpose and         //
//    have learned how to use it to my creative advantage. Many of my most personal images were made using direct midday light.        //
//                                                                                                                                     //
//    3. I learned to place 100% of the value in the experience– that coming back with a photo to represent that experience is a       //
//    gift, but not the goal.                                                                                                          //
//                                                                                                                                     //
//    4. I learned that light on water is one of my favorite subjects– one that has turned into an obsessive passion which has         //
//    brought me the solace and comfort I need in this world. Though my first record of photographing direct light on water            //
//    happened in 2011, Falling Stars is the photograph that sparked a conscious exploration of the subject that eventually led        //
//    to the Ebb and Flow Collection and philosophy, something that has become the most personally significant body of work I          //
//    have ever created.                                                                                                               //
//                                                                                                                                     //
//    This image is important to me. It speaks to me of reaching for the stars and reminds me of one of the most impactful             //
//    experiences of my photography career. I wouldn’t be the photographer I am today without that experience and I’m happy            //
//    that I have this photo to represent it.                                                                                          //
//                                                                                                                                     //

 * @dev Library for reading and writing primitive types to specific storage slots.

 * Storage slots are often used to avoid storage conflict when dealing with upgradeable contracts.
 * This library helps with reading and writing to such slots without the need for inline assembly.

 *
 * Example usage to set ERC1967 implementation slot:
 * ```
 * contract ERC1967 {
 *     bytes32 internal constant _IMPLEMENTATION_SLOT = 0x360894a13ba1a3210667c828492db98dca3e2076cc3735a920a3ca505d382bbc;

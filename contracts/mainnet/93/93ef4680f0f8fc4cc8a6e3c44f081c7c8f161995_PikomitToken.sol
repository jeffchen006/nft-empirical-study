Pikomit Token
website: www.pikomittoken.com   |   twitter: twitter.com/pikomittoken |  telegram: t.me/pikomittoken
Pikomit is a decentralized cryptocurrency on Ethereum Smart Contract.  A decentralized application is 
an application that can operate autonomously, typically through the use of smart contracts, that runs on 
decentralized computing, and blockchain systems. Like traditional applications, D-apps provide some 
function or utility to their users. Pikomit is coming up with D-app that offers decentralized services, where 
no third party is required. Pikomit is a verified smart contract on Ethereum Blockchain that can be 
accessed from anywhere in the world. Pikomit team is specialized in creative passive income sources 
globally. This is a Decentralized Finance project set to have no limitations on earning and no controller to 
access the funds, so we have no control over your money. We have created the smart contract in such a 
way that it functions autonomously using transaction cost as its fuel. It requires no extra inputs and its 
simple function is to calculate and distribute rewards. Cryptocurrency is advancing at lightning speed and 
has applications in many fields, from finance and law to art Cryptocurrency, despite its volatility, has 
become one of the most promising objects of investment for companies and individuals. In our opinion, 
this rapid development of the blockchain world creates a large gap between the products of this technology 
and its applications. 
VISION
Pikmot has consciously engaged in significant public consultation to create a distinctive and cooperative 
community strategy for Pikomit Token's exceptional growth. We aim to add more value to altcoin, therefore 
at Pikomit app, we have PIKOMIT to change your perspective.
MISSION
Our mission is to provide a perfect ecosystem for every community. Pikomit Token has defined "pillars" that 
we believe will be acknowledged and meet social issues. Furthermore, Pikomit will provide you with rapid 
transactions, low gas prices, and a lot of launchpad projects in the near future. The team has implemented 
all their experience in the Pikomit to make our crypto space even more convenient and easy to use for our 
customers. 
GOAL
Our target is to allow local communities to use Pikomit, whatever their network is.The mission of Pikomit 
dApp is to allow people, groups, friends, communities to communicate and organize themself with a strong 
censorship resistant approach. Pikomit with its tax will in our opinion, become the king of altcoins.

to come.
TRUST
Pikomit is an ecosystem where you are in control. The liquidity will be locked at launch – all intended to 
give you the peace of mind you need.
TOKENOMICS
Pikomit Token (PIKOMIT) is a digital asset that supports the ecosystem of the pikomit platform and is 
compliant with the ERC-20 token standard for the Ethereum blockchain with mature security performance, 
processing power, and various durability features.
With the total amount of Pikomit tokens issued limited to 800 million, the circulating supply of Pikomit tokens 
will be reduced as more users lock to enjoy the above utilities. The services available on our platform will 
expand in the future, and the utility of Pikomit tokens will expand accordingly. In addition, we plan to attract 
a number of company-operated projects to the pikomit platform, and we expect to use our capital strength to 
lock in large amounts for large-scale marketing activities. As a result, $PIKOMIT will be bought from the 
market, a mechanism that will maintain and improve prices.

/**
  A :sol:mod:`Committee` contract is a contract that the exchange service sends committee member
  signatures to attesting that they have a copy of the data over which a new Merkel root is to be
  accepted as the new state root. In addition, the exchange contract can call an availability
  verifier to check if such signatures were indeed provided by a sufficient number of committee
  members as hard coded in the :sol:mod:`Committee` contract for a given state transition
  (as reflected by the old and new vault and order roots).

  The exchange contract will normally query only one :sol:mod:`Committee` contract for data
  availability checks. However, in the event that the committee needs to be updated, additional
  availability verifiers may be registered with the exchange contract by the
  contract :sol:mod:`MainGovernance`. Such new availability verifiers are then also be required to
  attest to the data availability for state transitions and only if all the availability verifiers
  attest to it, the state transition is accepted.

  Removal of availability verifiers is also the responsibility of the :sol:mod:`MainGovernance`.
  The removal process is more sensitive than availability verifier registration as it may affect the
  soundness of the system. Hence, this is performed in two steps:

  1. The :sol:mod:`MainGovernance` first announces the intent to remove an availability verifier by calling :sol:func:`announceAvailabilityVerifierRemovalIntent`
  2. After the expiration of a `VERIFIER_REMOVAL_DELAY` time lock, actual removal may be performed by calling :sol:func:`removeAvailabilityVerifier`

  The removal delay ensures that a user concerned about the soundness of the system has ample time
  to leave the exchange.

/**
  The StarkEx contract is governed by one or more Governors of which the initial one is the
  deployer of the contract.

  A governor has the sole authority to perform the following operations:

  1. Nominate additional governors (:sol:func:`mainNominateNewGovernor`)
  2. Remove other governors (:sol:func:`mainRemoveGovernor`)
  3. Add new :sol:mod:`Verifiers` and :sol:mod:`AvailabilityVerifiers`
  4. Remove :sol:mod:`Verifiers` and :sol:mod:`AvailabilityVerifiers` after a timelock allows it
  5. Nominate Operators (see :sol:mod:`Operator`) and Token Administrators (see :sol:mod:`TokenRegister`)

  Adding governors is performed in a two step procedure:

  1. First, an existing governor nominates a new governor (:sol:func:`mainNominateNewGovernor`)
  2. Then, the new governor must accept governance to become a governor (:sol:func:`mainAcceptGovernance`)

  This two step procedure ensures that a governor public key cannot be nominated unless there is an
  entity that has the corresponding private key. This is intended to prevent errors in the addition
  process.

  The governor private key should typically be held in a secure cold wallet.

/**
  A Verifier contract is an implementation of a STARK verifier that the exchange service sends
  STARK proofs to. In addition, the exchange contract can call a verifier to check if a valid proof
  has been accepted for a given state transition (typically described as a hash on the public input
  of the assumed proof).

  The exchange contract will normally query only one verifier contract for proof validity checks.
  However, in the event that the verifier algorithm needs to updated, additional verifiers may be
  registered with the exchange contract by the contract :sol:mod:`MainGovernance`. Such new
  verifiers are then also be required to attest to the validity of state transitions and only if all
  the verifiers attest to the validity the state transition is accepted.

  Removal of verifiers is also the responsibility of the :sol:mod:`MainGovernance`. The removal
  process is more sensitive than verifier registration as it may affect the soundness of the system.
  Hence, this is performed in two steps:

  1. The :sol:mod:`MainGovernance` first announces the intent to remove a verifier by calling :sol:func:`announceVerifierRemovalIntent`
  2. After the expiration of a `VERIFIER_REMOVAL_DELAY` time lock, actual removal may be performed by calling :sol:func:`removeVerifier`

  The removal delay ensures that a user concerned about the soundness of the system has ample time
  to leave the exchange.

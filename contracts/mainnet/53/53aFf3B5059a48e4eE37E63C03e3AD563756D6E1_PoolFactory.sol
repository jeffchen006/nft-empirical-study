 * @title Pool Factory V2
 *
 * @dev Pool Factory manages Illuvium staking pools, provides a single
 *      public interface to access the pools, provides an interface for the pools
 *      to mint yield rewards, access pool-related info, update weights, etc.
 *
 * @dev The factory is authorized (via its owner) to register new pools, change weights
 *      of the existing pools, removing the pools (by changing their weights to zero).
 *
 * @dev The factory requires ROLE_TOKEN_CREATOR permission on the ILV and sILV tokens to mint yield
 *      (see `mintYieldTo` function).
 *
 * @notice The contract uses Ownable implementation, so only the eDAO is able to handle
 *         admin activities, such as registering new pools, doing contract upgrades,
 *         changing pool weights, managing emission schedules and so on.

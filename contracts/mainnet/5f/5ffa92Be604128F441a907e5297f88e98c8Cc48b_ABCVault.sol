/*
 * @title: Asteroid Belt Club Vault Smart Contract
 * @author: Gustavo Hernandez Baratta  (The Pan de Azucar Bay Company LLC)
 * @dev: The vault is the smart contract in which the CLUB's digital assets are stored.
 * Funds stored in the vault can only be transferred to third parties through a three-step 
 * mechanism implemented in the addPayment, approvePayment and pay functions. 
 * addPayment allows scheduling a future payment, which must be approved by invoking the 
 * approvePayment function. Finally the payment is released and the beneficiary can execute the pay function and receive the funds.
 * Between steps there is a constraint of approximately 10 days (63000 blocks). 
 * The vault and individual payments can be paused in case of emergency by invoking the functions pause and pausePayment.
 *
 * The vault management rules are designed to prevent now or in the future practices known as "rug pulling". 
 * Initially the owner of the vault is the ABC contract itself, and no function is programmed to initiate the payment process. 
 * Once the DAO is designed, a smart contract will receive ownership and with it the ability to add new payments and pause 
 * the vault and individual contracts. But the process of approving a new payment will require a second contract 
 * to approve it (this function should be fulfilled by the voting contract from which the community approves and 
 * authorizes it), and there will be a restriction period long enough to alert on any improper payments.

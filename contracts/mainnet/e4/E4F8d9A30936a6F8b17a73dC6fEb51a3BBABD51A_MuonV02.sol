  /** **************************************************************************
      @notice verifySignature returns true iff passed a valid Schnorr signature.
      @dev See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schnorr_signature for reference.
      @dev In what follows, let d be your secret key, PK be your public key,
      PKx be the x ordinate of your public key, and PKyp be the parity bit for
      the y ordinate (i.e., 0 if PKy is even, 1 if odd.)
      **************************************************************************
      @dev TO CREATE A VALID SIGNATURE FOR THIS METHOD
      @dev First PKx must be less than HALF_Q. Then follow these instructions
           (see evm/test/schnorr_test.js, for an example of carrying them out):
      @dev 1. Hash the target message to a uint256, called msgHash here, using
              keccak256
      @dev 2. Pick k uniformly and cryptographically securely randomly from
              {0,...,Q-1}. It is critical that k remains confidential, as your
              private key can be reconstructed from k and the signature.
      @dev 3. Compute k*g in the secp256k1 group, where g is the group
              generator. (This is the same as computing the public key from the
              secret key k. But it's OK if k*g's x ordinate is greater than
              HALF_Q.)
      @dev 4. Compute the ethereum address for k*g. This is the lower 160 bits
              of the keccak hash of the concatenated affine coordinates of k*g,
              as 32-byte big-endians. (For instance, you could pass k to
              ethereumjs-utils's privateToAddress to compute this, though that
              should be strictly a development convenience, not for handling
              live secrets, unless you've locked your javascript environment
              down very carefully.) Call this address
              nonceTimesGeneratorAddress.
      @dev 5. Compute e=uint256(keccak256(PKx as a 32-byte big-endian
                                        ‖ PKyp as a single byte
                                        ‖ msgHash
                                        ‖ nonceTimesGeneratorAddress))
              This value e is called "msgChallenge" in verifySignature's source
              code below. Here "‖" means concatenation of the listed byte
              arrays.
      @dev 6. Let x be your secret key. Compute s = (k - d * e) % Q. Add Q to
              it, if it's negative. This is your signature. (d is your secret
              key.)
      **************************************************************************
      @dev TO VERIFY A SIGNATURE
      @dev Given a signature (s, e) of msgHash, constructed as above, compute
      S=e*PK+s*generator in the secp256k1 group law, and then the ethereum
      address of S, as described in step 4. Call that
      nonceTimesGeneratorAddress. Then call the verifySignature method as:
      @dev    verifySignature(PKx, PKyp, s, msgHash,
                              nonceTimesGeneratorAddress)
      **************************************************************************
      @dev This signging scheme deviates slightly from the classical Schnorr
      signature, in that the address of k*g is used in place of k*g itself,
      both when calculating e and when verifying sum S as described in the
      verification paragraph above. This reduces the difficulty of
      brute-forcing a signature by trying random secp256k1 points in place of
      k*g in the signature verification process from 256 bits to 160 bits.
      However, the difficulty of cracking the public key using "baby-step,
      giant-step" is only 128 bits, so this weakening constitutes no compromise
      in the security of the signatures or the key.
      @dev The constraint signingPubKeyX < HALF_Q comes from Eq. (281), p. 24
      of Yellow Paper version 78d7b9a. ecrecover only accepts "s" inputs less
      than HALF_Q, to protect against a signature- malleability vulnerability in
      ECDSA. Schnorr does not have this vulnerability, but we must account for
      ecrecover's defense anyway. And since we are abusing ecrecover by putting
      signingPubKeyX in ecrecover's "s" argument the constraint applies to
      signingPubKeyX, even though it represents a value in the base field, and
      has no natural relationship to the order of the curve's cyclic group.
      **************************************************************************
      @param signingPubKeyX is the x ordinate of the public key. This must be
             less than HALF_Q. 
      @param pubKeyYParity is 0 if the y ordinate of the public key is even, 1 
             if it's odd.
      @param signature is the actual signature, described as s in the above
             instructions.
      @param msgHash is a 256-bit hash of the message being signed.
      @param nonceTimesGeneratorAddress is the ethereum address of k*g in the
             above instructions

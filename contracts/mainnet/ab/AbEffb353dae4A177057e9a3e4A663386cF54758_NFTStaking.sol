/**
 * @title Access Control List
 *
 * @notice Access control smart contract provides an API to check
 *      if specific operation is permitted globally and/or
 *      if particular user has a permission to execute it.
 *
 * @notice It deals with two main entities: features and roles.
 *
 * @notice Features are designed to be used to enable/disable specific
 *      functions (public functions) of the smart contract for everyone.
 * @notice User roles are designed to restrict access to specific
 *      functions (restricted functions) of the smart contract to some users.
 *
 * @notice Terms "role", "permissions" and "set of permissions" have equal meaning
 *      in the documentation text and may be used interchangeably.
 * @notice Terms "permission", "single permission" implies only one permission bit set.
 *
 * @notice Access manager is a special role which allows to grant/revoke other roles.
 *      Access managers can only grant/revoke permissions which they have themselves.
 *      As an example, access manager with no other roles set can only grant/revoke its own
 *      access manager permission and nothing else.
 *
 * @notice Access manager permission should be treated carefully, as a super admin permission:
 *      Access manager with even no other permission can interfere with another account by
 *      granting own access manager permission to it and effectively creating more powerful
 *      permission set than its own.
 *
 * @dev Both current and OpenZeppelin AccessControl implementations feature a similar API
 *      to check/know "who is allowed to do this thing".
 * @dev Zeppelin implementation is more flexible:
 *      - it allows setting unlimited number of roles, while current is limited to 256 different roles
 *      - it allows setting an admin for each role, while current allows having only one global admin
 * @dev Current implementation is more lightweight:
 *      - it uses only 1 bit per role, while Zeppelin uses 256 bits
 *      - it allows setting up to 256 roles at once, in a single transaction, while Zeppelin allows
 *        setting only one role in a single transaction
 *
 * @dev This smart contract is designed to be inherited by other
 *      smart contracts which require access control management capabilities.
 *
 * @dev Access manager permission has a bit 255 set.
 *      This bit must not be used by inheriting contracts for any other permissions/features.

	 * @dev Example:
	 *      Consider an operator with the permissions bitmask     00001111
	 *      is about to modify the target permission set          01010101
	 *      Operator wants to set that permission set to          00110011
	 *      Based on their role, an operator has the permissions
	 *      to update only lowest 4 bits on the target, meaning that
	 *      high 4 bits of the target set in this example is left
	 *      unchanged and low 4 bits get changed as desired:      01010011
	 *

/**
 * @dev Contract module that allows children to implement role-based access
 * control mechanisms. This is a lightweight version that doesn't allow enumerating role
 * members except through off-chain means by accessing the contract event logs. Some
 * applications may benefit from on-chain enumerability, for those cases see
 * {AccessControlEnumerable}.
 *
 * Roles are referred to by their `bytes32` identifier. These should be exposed
 * in the external API and be unique. The best way to achieve this is by
 * using `public constant` hash digests:
 *
 * ```
 * bytes32 public constant MY_ROLE = keccak256("MY_ROLE");
 * ```
 *
 * Roles can be used to represent a set of permissions. To restrict access to a
 * function call, use {hasRole}:
 *
 * ```
 * function foo() public {
 *     require(hasRole(MY_ROLE, msg.sender));
 *     ...
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Roles can be granted and revoked dynamically via the {grantRole} and
 * {revokeRole} functions. Each role has an associated admin role, and only
 * accounts that have a role's admin role can call {grantRole} and {revokeRole}.
 *
 * By default, the admin role for all roles is `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`, which means
 * that only accounts with this role will be able to grant or revoke other
 * roles. More complex role relationships can be created by using
 * {_setRoleAdmin}.
 *
 * WARNING: The `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` is also its own admin: it has permission to
 * grant and revoke this role. Extra precautions should be taken to secure
 * accounts that have been granted it.

 * TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as

 *
 * CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure
 * that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.
 *
 * [CAUTION]
 * ====
 * Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized.
 *
 * An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation
 * contract, which may impact the proxy. To prevent the implementation contract from being used, you should invoke
 * the {_disableInitializers} function in the constructor to automatically lock it when it is deployed:

 * @title LS1Rewards
 * @author MarginX
 *
 * @dev Manages the distribution of token rewards.
 *
 *  Rewards are distributed continuously. After each second, an account earns rewards `r` according
 *  to the following formula:
 *
 *      r = R * s / S
 *
 *  Where:
 *    - `R` is the rewards distributed globally each second, also called the “emission rate.”
 *    - `s` is the account's staked balance in that second (technically, it is measured at the
 *      end of the second)
 *    - `S` is the sum total of all staked balances in that second (again, measured at the end of
 *      the second)
 *
 *  The parameter `R` can be configured by the contract owner. For every second that elapses,
 *  exactly `R` tokens will accrue to users, save for rounding errors, and with the exception that
 *  while the total staked balance is zero, no tokens will accrue to anyone.
 *
 *  The accounting works as follows: A global index is stored which represents the cumulative
 *  number of rewards tokens earned per staked token since the start of the distribution.
 *  The value of this index increases over time, and there are two factors affecting the rate of
 *  increase:
 *    1) The emission rate (in the numerator)
 *    2) The total number of staked tokens (in the denominator)
 *
 *  Whenever either factor changes, in some timestamp T, we settle the global index up to T by
 *  calculating the increase in the index since the last update using the OLD values of the factors:
 *
 *    indexDelta = timeDelta * emissionPerSecond * INDEX_BASE / totalStaked
 *
 *  Where `INDEX_BASE` is a scaling factor used to allow more precision in the storage of the index.
 *
 *  For each user we store an accrued rewards balance, as well as a user index, which is a cache of
 *  the global index at the time that the user's accrued rewards balance was last updated. Then at
 *  any point in time, a user's claimable rewards are represented by the following:
 *
 *    rewards = _USER_REWARDS_BALANCES_[user] + userStaked * (
 *                settledGlobalIndex - _USER_INDEXES_[user]
 *              ) / INDEX_BASE

/**
 * @title LS1StakedBalances
 * @author MarginX
 *
 * @dev Accounting of staked balances.
 *
 *  NOTE: Internal functions may revert if epoch zero has not started.
 *
 *  STAKED BALANCE ACCOUNTING:
 *
 *   A staked balance is in one of two states:
 *     - active: Available for borrowing; earning staking rewards; cannot be withdrawn by staker.
 *     - inactive: Unavailable for borrowing; does not earn rewards; can be withdrawn by the staker.
 *
 *   A staker may have a combination of active and inactive balances. The following operations
 *   affect staked balances as follows:
 *     - deposit:            Increase active balance.
 *     - request withdrawal: At the end of the current epoch, move some active funds to inactive.
 *     - withdraw:           Decrease inactive balance.
 *     - transfer:           Move some active funds to another staker.
 *
 *   To encode the fact that a balance may be scheduled to change at the end of a certain epoch, we
 *   store each balance as a struct of three fields: currentEpoch, currentEpochBalance, and
 *   nextEpochBalance. Also, inactive user balances make use of the shortfallCounter field as
 *   described below.
 *
 *  INACTIVE BALANCE ACCOUNTING:
 *
 *   Inactive funds may be subject to pro-rata socialized losses in the event of a shortfall where
 *   a borrower is late to pay back funds that have been requested for withdrawal. We track losses
 *   via indexes. Each index represents the fraction of inactive funds that were converted into
 *   debt during a given shortfall event. Each staker inactive balance stores a cached shortfall
 *   counter, representing the number of shortfalls that occurred in the past relative to when the
 *   balance was last updated.
 *
 *   Any losses incurred by an inactive balance translate into an equal credit to that staker's
 *   debt balance. See LS1DebtAccounting for more info about how the index is calculated.
 *
 *  REWARDS ACCOUNTING:
 *
 *   Active funds earn rewards for the period of time that they remain active. This means, after
 *   requesting a withdrawal of some funds, those funds will continue to earn rewards until the end
 *   of the epoch. For example:
 *
 *     epoch: n        n + 1      n + 2      n + 3
 *            |          |          |          |
 *            +----------+----------+----------+-----...
 *               ^ t_0: User makes a deposit.
 *                          ^ t_1: User requests a withdrawal of all funds.
 *                                  ^ t_2: The funds change state from active to inactive.
 *
 *   In the above scenario, the user would earn rewards for the period from t_0 to t_2, varying
 *   with the total staked balance in that period. If the user only request a withdrawal for a part
 *   of their balance, then the remaining balance would continue earning rewards beyond t_2.
 *
 *   User rewards must be settled via LS1Rewards any time a user's active balance changes. Special
 *   attention is paid to the the epoch boundaries, where funds may have transitioned from active
 *   to inactive.
 *
 *  SETTLEMENT DETAILS:
 *
 *   Internally, this module uses the following types of operations on stored balances:
 *     - Load:            Loads a balance, while applying settlement logic internally to get the
 *                        up-to-date result. Returns settlement results without updating state.
 *     - Store:           Stores a balance.
 *     - Load-for-update: Performs a load and applies updates as needed to rewards or debt balances.
 *                        Since this is state-changing, it must be followed by a store operation.
 *     - Settle:          Performs load-for-update and store operations.
 *
 *   This module is responsible for maintaining the following invariants to ensure rewards are
 *   calculated correctly:
 *     - When an active balance is loaded for update, if a rollover occurs from one epoch to the
 *       next, the rewards index must be settled up to the boundary at which the rollover occurs.
 *     - Because the global rewards index is needed to update the user rewards index, the total
 *       active balance must be settled before any staker balances are settled or loaded for update.
 *     - A staker's balance must be settled before their rewards are settled.

/**
 * @dev Wrappers over Solidity's uintXX/intXX casting operators with added overflow

 * Downcasting from uint256/int256 in Solidity does not revert on overflow. This can
 * easily result in undesired exploitation or bugs, since developers usually
 * assume that overflows raise errors. `SafeCast` restores this intuition by
 * reverting the transaction when such an operation overflows.
 *
 * Using this library instead of the unchecked operations eliminates an entire
 * class of bugs, so it's recommended to use it always.
 *
 * Can be combined with {SafeMath} and {SignedSafeMath} to extend it to smaller types, by performing
 * all math on `uint256` and `int256` and then downcasting.

/**
 * @title Land Sale
 *
 * @notice Enables the Land NFT sale via dutch auction mechanism
 *
 * @notice The proposed volume of land is approximately 100,000 plots, split amongst the 7 regions.
 *      The volume is released over a series of staggered sales with the first sale featuring
 *      about 20,000 land plots (tokens).
 *
 * @notice Land plots are sold in sequences, each sequence groups tokens which are sold in parallel.
 *      Sequences start selling one by one with the configurable time interval between their start.
 *      A sequence is available for a sale for a fixed (configurable) amount of time, meaning they
 *      can overlap (tokens from several sequences are available on sale simultaneously) if this
 *      amount of time is bigger than interval between sequences start.
 *
 * @notice The sale operates in a configurable time interval which should be aligned with the
 *      total number of sequences, their duration, and start interval.
 *      Sale smart contract has no idea of the total number of sequences and doesn't validate
 *      if these timings are correctly aligned.
 *
 * @notice Starting prices of the plots are defined by the plot tier in ETH, and are configurable
 *      within the sale contract per tier ID.
 *      Token price declines over time exponentially, price halving time is configurable.
 *      The exponential price decline simulates the price drop requirement which may be formulated
 *      something like "the price drops by 'x' % every 'y' minutes".
 *      For example, if x = 2, and y = 1, "the price drops by 2% every minute", the halving
 *      time is around 34 minutes.
 *
 * @notice Sale accepts ETH and sILV as a payment currency, sILV price is supplied by on-chain
 *      price oracle (sILV price is assumed to be equal to ILV price)
 *
 * @notice The data required to mint a plot includes (see `PlotData` struct):
 *      - token ID, defines a unique ID for the land plot used as ERC721 token ID
 *      - sequence ID, defines the time frame when the plot is available for sale
 *      - region ID (1 - 7), determines which tileset to use in game,
 *      - coordinates (x, y) on the overall world map, indicating which grid position the land sits in,
 *      - tier ID (1 - 5), the rarity of the land, tier is used to create the list of sites,
 *      - size (w, h), defines an internal coordinate system within a plot,
 *
 * @notice Since minting a plot requires at least 32 bytes of data and due to a significant
 *      amount of plots to be minted (about 100,000), pre-storing this data on-chain
 *      is not a viable option (2,000,000,000 of gas only to pay for the storage).
 *      Instead, we represent the whole land plot data collection on sale as a Merkle tree
 *      structure and store the root of the Merkle tree on-chain.
 *      To buy a particular plot, the buyer must know the entire collection and be able to
 *      generate and present the Merkle proof for this particular plot.
 *
 * @notice The input data is a collection of `PlotData` structures; the Merkle tree is built out
 *      from this collection, and the tree root is stored on the contract by the data manager.
 *      When buying a plot, the buyer also specifies the Merkle proof for a plot data to mint.
 *
 * @notice Layer 2 support (ex. IMX minting)
 *      Sale contract supports both L1 and L2 sales.
 *      L1 sale mints the token in layer 1 network (Ethereum mainnet) immediately,
 *      in the same transaction it is bought.
 *      L2 sale doesn't mint the token and just emits an event containing token metadata and owner;
 *      this event is then picked by the off-chain process (daemon) which mints the token in a
 *      layer 2 network (IMX, https://www.immutable.com/)
 *
 * @dev A note on randomness
 *      Current implementation uses "on-chain randomness" to mint a land plot, which is calculated
 *      as a keccak256 hash of some available parameters, like token ID, buyer address, and block
 *      timestamp.
 *      This can be relatively easy manipulated not only by miners, but even by clients wrapping
 *      their transactions into the smart contract code when buying (calling a `buy` function).
 *      It is considered normal and acceptable from the security point of view since the value
 *      of such manipulation is low compared to the transaction cost.
 *      This situation can change, however, in the future sales when more information on the game
 *      is available, and when it becomes more clear how resource types and their positions
 *      affect the game mechanics, and can be used to benefit players.
 *
 * @dev A note on timestamps
 *      Current implementation uses uint32 to represent unix timestamp, and time intervals,
 *      it is not designed to be used after February 7, 2106, 06:28:15 GMT (unix time 0xFFFFFFFF)
 *
 * @dev Merkle proof verification is based on OpenZeppelin implementation, see
 *      https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/utils#MerkleProof

 * @title Upgradeable Access Control List // ERC1967Proxy
 *
 * @notice Access control smart contract provides an API to check
 *      if a specific operation is permitted globally and/or
 *      if a particular user has a permission to execute it.
 *
 * @notice It deals with two main entities: features and roles.
 *
 * @notice Features are designed to be used to enable/disable public functions
 *      of the smart contract (used by a wide audience).
 * @notice User roles are designed to control the access to restricted functions
 *      of the smart contract (used by a limited set of maintainers).
 *
 * @notice Terms "role", "permissions" and "set of permissions" have equal meaning
 *      in the documentation text and may be used interchangeably.
 * @notice Terms "permission", "single permission" implies only one permission bit set.
 *
 * @notice Access manager is a special role which allows to grant/revoke other roles.
 *      Access managers can only grant/revoke permissions which they have themselves.
 *      As an example, access manager with no other roles set can only grant/revoke its own
 *      access manager permission and nothing else.
 *
 * @notice Access manager permission should be treated carefully, as a super admin permission:
 *      Access manager with even no other permission can interfere with another account by
 *      granting own access manager permission to it and effectively creating more powerful
 *      permission set than its own.
 *
 * @dev Both current and OpenZeppelin AccessControl implementations feature a similar API
 *      to check/know "who is allowed to do this thing".
 * @dev Zeppelin implementation is more flexible:
 *      - it allows setting unlimited number of roles, while current is limited to 256 different roles
 *      - it allows setting an admin for each role, while current allows having only one global admin
 * @dev Current implementation is more lightweight:
 *      - it uses only 1 bit per role, while Zeppelin uses 256 bits
 *      - it allows setting up to 256 roles at once, in a single transaction, while Zeppelin allows
 *        setting only one role in a single transaction
 *
 * @dev This smart contract is designed to be inherited by other
 *      smart contracts which require access control management capabilities.
 *
 * @dev Access manager permission has a bit 255 set.
 *      This bit must not be used by inheriting contracts for any other permissions/features.
 *
 * @dev This is an upgradeable version of the ACL, based on Zeppelin implementation for ERC1967,

	 *      Based on their role, an operator has the permissions

	 *      high 4 bits of the target set in this example is left
	 *      unchanged and low 4 bits get changed as desired:      01010011

/**
 * @dev This is a base contract to aid in writing upgradeable contracts, or any kind of contract that will be deployed
 * behind a proxy. Since a proxied contract can't have a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an
 * external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer
 * function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.
 *
 * TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as
 * possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}.
 *
 * CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure
 * that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.
 *
 * [CAUTION]
 * ====
 * Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized.
 *
 * An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation
 * contract, which may impact the proxy. To initialize the implementation contract, you can either invoke the
 * initializer manually, or you can include a constructor to automatically mark it as initialized when it is deployed:

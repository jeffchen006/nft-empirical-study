 *      Additionally, 3 token instance addresses must be defined on deployment:
 *          - HIGH token address
 *          - pool token address, it can be HIGH token address, HIGH/ETH pair address, and others
 *
 * @dev Pool weight defines the fraction of the yield current pool receives among the other pools,
 *      pool factory is responsible for the weight synchronization between the pools.
 * @dev The weight is logically 20% for HIGH pool and 80% for HIGH/ETH pool.
 *      Since Solidity doesn't support fractions the weight is defined by the division of
 *      pool weight by total pools weight (sum of all registered pools within the factory)

/// @notice `ITier` is a simple interface that contracts can
/// implement to provide membership lists for other contracts.
///
/// There are many use-cases for a time-preserving conditional membership list.
///
/// Some examples include:
///
/// - Self-serve whitelist to participate in fundraising
/// - Lists of users who can claim airdrops and perks
/// - Pooling resources with implied governance/reward tiers
/// - POAP style attendance proofs allowing access to future exclusive events
///
/// @dev Standard interface to a tiered membership.
///
/// A "membership" can represent many things:
/// - Exclusive access.
/// - Participation in some event or process.
/// - KYC completion.
/// - Combination of sub-memberships.
/// - Etc.
///
/// The high level requirements for a contract implementing `ITier`:
/// - MUST represent held tiers as a `uint`.
/// - MUST implement `report`.
///   - The report is a `uint256` that SHOULD represent the block each tier has
///     been continuously held since encoded as `uint32`.
///   - The encoded tiers start at `1`; Tier `0` is implied if no tier has ever
///     been held.
///   - Tier `0` is NOT encoded in the report, it is simply the fallback value.
///   - If a tier is lost the block data is erased for that tier and will be
///     set if/when the tier is regained to the new block.
///   - If a tier is held but the historical block information is not available
///     the report MAY return `0x00000000` for all held tiers.
///   - Tiers that are lost or have never been held MUST return `0xFFFFFFFF`.
/// - SHOULD implement `setTier`.
///   - Contracts SHOULD revert with `SET_TIER` error if they cannot
///     meaningfully set a tier directly.
///     For example a contract that can only derive a membership tier by
///     reading the state of an external contract cannot set tiers.
///   - Contracts implementing `setTier` SHOULD error with `SET_ZERO_TIER`
///     if tier 0 is being set.
/// - MUST emit `TierChange` when `setTier` successfully writes a new tier.
///   - Contracts that cannot meaningfully set a tier are exempt.
///
/// So the four possible states and report values are:
/// - Tier is held and block is known: Block is in the report
/// - Tier is held but block is NOT known: `0` is in the report
/// - Tier is NOT held: `0xFF..` is in the report
/// - Tier is unknown: `0xFF..` is in the report

 * @dev This is a base contract to aid in writing upgradeable contracts, or any kind of contract that will be deployed

 * external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer
 * function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.
 *
 * TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as
 * possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}.
 *
 * CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure
 * that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.

 *
 * An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation
 * contract, which may impact the proxy. To initialize the implementation contract, you can either invoke the

* @notice The TokenType struct holds all the data that defines a collection of
* tokens within this contract
* @param id  The id of the collection
* @param supplyCap  The total number of tokens of the collection type that can
* exist
* @param cost  The cost to mint a token of the collection
* @param initialMintAmount  The amount of tokens to premint when the collection
* is created
* @param defaultStorageSchema  The default location/protocol used to store and
* retrieve the metadata of tokens in the collection
* @param totalSupply  The total circulating supply of the collection (i.e. the
* amount of tokens that have been minted from the collection so far)
* @param maxMultiplier  Nft collections that are part of this contract pay
* royalties to their beneficaries (charitable organizations that align with the
* collection's mandates). A multiplier can be applied to the royalty values so
* that a higer portion of a transaction goes to the beneficaries and less goes
* to the other recipient of the transaction. The max multiplier ensures that the
* multiplier never causes the royalty protion to be more than 100% of the
* transaction's value
* @param maxMint  The max number of tokens that can be minted from the collection
* in a single mint transaction
* @param fungible  True if it is a collection of fungible tokens, false if it
* is a collection of non-fungible tokens
* @param locked  True if the collection has been locked, false if it has not been.
* When a collection has been locked its supplyCap, cost, maxMint and mintable
* values can no longer be modified
* @param initialMintTo  Recipient of premint tokens
* @param mandates  Mandates that define the mission/purpose of a collection
* @param baseUris  The uri strings for retrieving the metadata of the tokens in
* the collection. Follows the erc1155 id substitution format

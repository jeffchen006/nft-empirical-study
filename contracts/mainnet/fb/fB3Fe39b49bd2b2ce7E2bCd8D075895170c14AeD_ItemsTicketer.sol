 *
 * Holders of this style of ticket have the right to transfer or
 * claim a given number of a physical consignment, escrowed by
 * Seen.Haus.
 *
 * Since this is an ERC155 implementation, the holder can
 * sell / transfer part or all of the balance of their ticketed
 * items rather than claim them all.
 *
 * N.B.: This contract supports piece-level reseller behavior,
 * e.g., an entity scooping up a bunch of the available items
 * in a multi-edition sale with the purpose of flipping each
 * item individually to make maximum profit.

  @title A simple staking contract for transfer-locking `Tiny721` items in
    exchange for tokens.
  @author Tim Clancy
  @author Rostislav Khlebnikov
  @author 0xthrpw

  This staking contract disburses tokens from its internal reservoir to those
  who stake `Tiny721` items, at a fixed rate of token per item independent of
  the number of items staked. It supports defining multiple time-locked pools
  with different rates.

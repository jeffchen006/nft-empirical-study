/**
 * @dev This is a base contract to aid in writing upgradeable contracts, or any kind of contract that will be deployed
 * behind a proxy. Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an
 * external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer
 * function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.
 *
 * The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be
 * reused. This mechanism prevents re-execution of each "step" but allows the creation of new initialization steps in
 * case an upgrade adds a module that needs to be initialized.
 *
 * For example:
 *
 * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]
 * ```solidity
 * contract MyToken is ERC20Upgradeable {
 *     function initialize() initializer public {
 *         __ERC20_init("MyToken", "MTK");
 *     }
 * }
 *
 * contract MyTokenV2 is MyToken, ERC20PermitUpgradeable {
 *     function initializeV2() reinitializer(2) public {
 *         __ERC20Permit_init("MyToken");
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as
 * possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}.
 *
 * CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure
 * that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.
 *
 * [CAUTION]
 * ====
 * Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized.
 *
 * An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation
 * contract, which may impact the proxy. To prevent the implementation contract from being used, you should invoke
 * the {_disableInitializers} function in the constructor to automatically lock it when it is deployed:
 *
 * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]
 * ```
 * /// @custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow constructor
 * constructor() {
 *     _disableInitializers();
 * }
 * ```

 * @dev This contract implements a proxy that is upgradeable by an admin.
 *
 * To avoid https://medium.com/nomic-labs-blog/malicious-backdoors-in-ethereum-proxies-62629adf3357[proxy selector
 * clashing], which can potentially be used in an attack, this contract uses the
 * https://blog.openzeppelin.com/the-transparent-proxy-pattern/[transparent proxy pattern]. This pattern implies two
 * things that go hand in hand:
 *
 * 1. If any account other than the admin calls the proxy, the call will be forwarded to the implementation, even if
 * that call matches one of the admin functions exposed by the proxy itself.
 * 2. If the admin calls the proxy, it can access the admin functions, but its calls will never be forwarded to the
 * implementation. If the admin tries to call a function on the implementation it will fail with an error that says
 * "admin cannot fallback to proxy target".
 *
 * These properties mean that the admin account can only be used for admin actions like upgrading the proxy or changing
 * the admin, so it's best if it's a dedicated account that is not used for anything else. This will avoid headaches due
 * to sudden errors when trying to call a function from the proxy implementation.
 *
 * Our recommendation is for the dedicated account to be an instance of the {ProxyAdmin} contract. If set up this way,
 * you should think of the `ProxyAdmin` instance as the real administrative interface of your proxy.
 *
 * NOTE: The real interface of this proxy is that defined in `ITransparentUpgradeableProxy`. This contract does not
 * inherit from that interface, and instead the admin functions are implicitly implemented using a custom dispatch
 * mechanism in `_fallback`. Consequently, the compiler will not produce an ABI for this contract. This is necessary to
 * fully implement transparency without decoding reverts caused by selector clashes between the proxy and the
 * implementation.
 *
 * WARNING: It is not recommended to extend this contract to add additional external functions. If you do so, the compiler
 * will not check that there are no selector conflicts, due to the note above. A selector clash between any new function
 * and the functions declared in {ITransparentUpgradeableProxy} will be resolved in favor of the new one. This could
 * render the admin operations inaccessible, which could prevent upgradeability. Transparency may also be compromised.

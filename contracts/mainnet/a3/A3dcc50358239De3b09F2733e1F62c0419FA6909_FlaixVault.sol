/**
 * @dev Library for managing
 * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(abstract_data_type)[sets] of primitive
 * types.
 *
 * Sets have the following properties:
 *
 * - Elements are added, removed, and checked for existence in constant time
 * (O(1)).
 * - Elements are enumerated in O(n). No guarantees are made on the ordering.
 *
 * ```
 * contract Example {
 *     // Add the library methods
 *     using EnumerableSet for EnumerableSet.AddressSet;
 *
 *     // Declare a set state variable
 *     EnumerableSet.AddressSet private mySet;
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * As of v3.3.0, sets of type `bytes32` (`Bytes32Set`), `address` (`AddressSet`)
 * and `uint256` (`UintSet`) are supported.
 *
 * [WARNING]
 * ====
 * Trying to delete such a structure from storage will likely result in data corruption, rendering the structure
 * unusable.
 * See https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11843[ethereum/solidity#11843] for more info.
 *
 * In order to clean an EnumerableSet, you can either remove all elements one by one or create a fresh instance using an
 * array of EnumerableSet.

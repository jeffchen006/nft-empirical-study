    The AllowList contract is used to manage a list of addresses and attest each address certain attributes.
    Examples for possible attributes are: is KYCed, is american, is of age, etc.
    One AllowList managed by one entity (e.g. tokenize.it) can manage up to 252 different attributes, and one tier with 5 levels, and can be used by an unlimited number of other Tokens.
*/
contract AllowList is Ownable2Step {
    /**
    @dev Attributes are defined as bit mask, with the bit position encoding it's meaning and the bit's value whether this attribute is attested or not. 
        Example:
        - position 0: 1 = has been KYCed (0 = not KYCed)
        - position 1: 1 = is american citizen (0 = not american citizen)
        - position 2: 1 = is a penguin (0 = not a penguin)
        These meanings are not defined within code, neither in the token contract nor the allowList. Nevertheless, the definition used by the people responsible for both contracts MUST match, 
        or the token contract will not work as expected. E.g. if the allowList defines position 2 as "is a penguin", while the token contract uses position 2 as "is a hedgehog", then the tokens 
        might be sold to hedgehogs, which was never the intention.
        Here some examples of how requirements can be used in practice:
        value 0b0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000101, means "is KYCed and is a penguin"
        value 0b0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000111, means "is KYCed, is american and is a penguin"
        value 0b0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000, means "has not proven any relevant attributes to the allowList operator" (default value)

        The highest four bits are defined as tiers as follows (depicted with less bits because 256 is a lot):
        - 0b0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 = tier 0 
        - 0b0001000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 = tier 1 
        - 0b0011000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 = tier 2 (and 1)
        - 0b0111000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 = tier 3 (and 2 and 1)
        - 0b1111000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 = tier 4 (and 3 and 2 and 1)
        This very simple definition allows for a maximum of 5 tiers, even though 4 bits are used for encoding. By sacrificing some space it can be implemented without code changes.

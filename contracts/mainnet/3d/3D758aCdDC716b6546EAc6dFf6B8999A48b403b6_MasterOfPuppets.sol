$PUPPET is a groundbreaking new decentralised cryptocurrency that empowers all individuals and challenges the control of the secret elite that pull the strings.
As the powers that be, start to close in on crypto and seek to regulate by force, it’s stands to us to make a stand and show these clowns that we won’t stand for it.

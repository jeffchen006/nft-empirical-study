/**
    @title  Crowd Funded HyPC Pool
    @author Barry Rowe, David Liendo
    @notice This contract allows users to pool their HyPC together to swap for a c_HyPC that can be used to back
            a license in the HyperCycle ecosystem. Because of the initial high volume of HyPC required for
            a swap, a pooling contract is useful for users wanting to have HyPC back their license. In this
            case, a license holder creates a proposal in the pool for 1 c_HyPC to back their license. They put up
            some backing HyPC as collateral for this loan, that will be used as interest payments for the users
            that provide HyPC for the proposal.

            As an example, a manager wants to borrow a c_HyPC for 18 months (78 weeks). The manager puts up 
            50,000 HyPC as collateral to act as interest for the user that deposit to this proposal. This means
            that the yearly APR for a depositor to the proposal will be: 50,000/524,288 * (26/39) = 0.063578288
            or roughly 6.35% (26 being the number of 2 week periods in a year, and 39 the number of 2 week
            periods in the proposal's term). The depositors can then claim this interest every period (2 weeks) 
            until the end of the proposal, at which point they can then withdraw and get back their initial 
            deposit. While the proposal is active, the c_HyPC is held by the pool contract itself, though the 
            manager that created the proposal can change the assignement of the swapped for c_HyPC.

/**
 * @title PermissionRegistry.
 * @dev A registry of smart contracts functions and ERC20 transfer limits that are allowed to be called between contracts.
 * A time delay in seconds over the permissions can be set form any contract, this delay would be added to any new
 * permissions sent by that address.
 * The PermissionRegistry owner (if there is an owner and owner address is not 0x0) can overwrite/set any permission.
 * The registry allows setting ERC20 limits, the limit needs to be set at the beggining of the block and then it can be
 * checked at any time. To remove or replace ERC20 limits first it needs to be removed and then it can be set again.
 * The smart contracts permissions are compound by the `from` address, `to` address, `value` uint256 and `fromTime` uint256,
 * if `fromTime` is zero it means the function is not allowed.

/**
 * @dev This is a base contract to aid in writing upgradeable contracts, or any kind of contract that will be deployed
 * behind a proxy. Since a proxied contract can't have a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an
 * external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer
 * function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.
 *
 * TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as
 * possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}.
 *
 * CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure
 * that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.
 *
 * [CAUTION]
 * ====
 * Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized.
 *
 * An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation
 * contract, which may impact the proxy. To initialize the implementation contract, you can either invoke the
 * initializer manually, or you can include a constructor to automatically mark it as initialized when it is deployed:
 *
 * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]
 * ```
 * /// @custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow constructor
 * constructor() initializer {}

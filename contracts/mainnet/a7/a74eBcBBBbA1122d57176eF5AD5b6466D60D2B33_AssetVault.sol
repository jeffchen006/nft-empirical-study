/**
  @title A vault for securely holding assets. This vault can hold Ether, ERC-20
    tokens, ERC-721 tokens, or ERC-1155 tokens.
  @author Tim Clancy
  @author Egor Dergunov

  The context of this vault contract is such that it is intended for use when
  owned by a separate multisignature-driven timelock contract. The justification
  for the timelock is such that, if the multisignature wallet is compromised,
  this vault empowers signatories to mitigate potential damage from an attacker
  via the `panic` function.

  It is recommended that assets be sent to this vault using the `deposit`
  function, which will correctly configure contract storage such that the
  `panic` function covers all assets. In the event that using `deposit` is not
  possible, assets may be manually configured via the `configure` function.

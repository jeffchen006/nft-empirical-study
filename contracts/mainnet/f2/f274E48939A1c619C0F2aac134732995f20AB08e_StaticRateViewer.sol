/**
 * @dev Contract module that allows children to implement role-based access
 * control mechanisms. This is a lightweight version that doesn't allow enumerating role
 * members except through off-chain means by accessing the contract event logs. Some
 * applications may benefit from on-chain enumerability, for those cases see
 * {AccessControlEnumerable}.
 *
 * Roles are referred to by their `bytes32` identifier. These should be exposed
 * in the external API and be unique. The best way to achieve this is by
 * using `public constant` hash digests:
 *
 * ```
 * bytes32 public constant MY_ROLE = keccak256("MY_ROLE");
 * ```
 *
 * Roles can be used to represent a set of permissions. To restrict access to a
 * function call, use {hasRole}:
 *
 * ```
 * function foo() public {
 *     require(hasRole(MY_ROLE, msg.sender));
 *     ...
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Roles can be granted and revoked dynamically via the {grantRole} and
 * {revokeRole} functions. Each role has an associated admin role, and only
 * accounts that have a role's admin role can call {grantRole} and {revokeRole}.
 *
 * By default, the admin role for all roles is `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`, which means
 * that only accounts with this role will be able to grant or revoke other
 * roles. More complex role relationships can be created by using
 * {_setRoleAdmin}.
 *
 * WARNING: The `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` is also its own admin: it has permission to
 * grant and revoke this role. Extra precautions should be taken to secure
 * accounts that have been granted it.

/**
 * @dev This is a base contract to aid in writing upgradeable contracts, or any kind of contract that will be deployed
 * behind a proxy. Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an
 * external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer
 * function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.
 *
 * The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be
 * reused. This mechanism prevents re-execution of each "step" but allows the creation of new initialization steps in
 * case an upgrade adds a module that needs to be initialized.
 *
 * For example:
 *
 * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]
 * ```
 * contract MyToken is ERC20Upgradeable {
 *     function initialize() initializer public {
 *         __ERC20_init("MyToken", "MTK");
 *     }
 * }
 * contract MyTokenV2 is MyToken, ERC20PermitUpgradeable {
 *     function initializeV2() reinitializer(2) public {
 *         __ERC20Permit_init("MyToken");
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as
 * possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}.
 *
 * CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure
 * that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.
 *
 * [CAUTION]
 * ====
 * Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized.
 *
 * An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation
 * contract, which may impact the proxy. To prevent the implementation contract from being used, you should invoke
 * the {_disableInitializers} function in the constructor to automatically lock it when it is deployed:
 *
 * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]
 * ```
 * /// @custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow constructor
 * constructor() {
 *     _disableInitializers();
 * }

     * Pool shares.
     *
     * If the caller is not `sender`, it must be an authorized relayer for them.
     *
     * The `assets` and `maxAmountsIn` arrays must have the same length, and each entry indicates the maximum amount
     * to send for each asset. The amounts to send are decided by the Pool and not the Vault: it just enforces
     * these maximums.
     *
     * If joining a Pool that holds WETH, it is possible to send ETH directly: the Vault will do the wrapping. To enable
     * this mechanism, the IAsset sentinel value (the zero address) must be passed in the `assets` array instead of the
     * WETH address. Note that it is not possible to combine ETH and WETH in the same join. Any excess ETH will be sent
     * back to the caller (not the sender, which is important for relayers).
     *
     * `assets` must have the same length and order as the array returned by `getPoolTokens`. This prevents issues when
     * interacting with Pools that register and deregister tokens frequently. If sending ETH however, the array must be
     * sorted *before* replacing the WETH address with the ETH sentinel value (the zero address), which means the final
     * `assets` array might not be sorted. Pools with no registered tokens cannot be joined.
     *
     * If `fromInternalBalance` is true, the caller's Internal Balance will be preferred: ERC20 transfers will only
     * be made for the difference between the requested amount and Internal Balance (if any). Note that ETH cannot be
     * withdrawn from Internal Balance: attempting to do so will trigger a revert.
     *
     * This causes the Vault to call the `IBasePool.onJoinPool` hook on the Pool's contract, where Pools implement
     * their own custom logic. This typically requires additional information from the user (such as the expected number
     * of Pool shares). This can be encoded in the `userData` argument, which is ignored by the Vault and passed
     * directly to the Pool's contract, as is `recipient`.
     *
     * Emits a `PoolBalanceChanged` event.

     * @dev Called by users to exit a Pool, which transfers tokens from the Pool's balance to `recipient`. This will
     * trigger custom Pool behavior, which will typically ask for something in return from `sender` - often tokenized
     * Pool shares. The amount of tokens that can be withdrawn is limited by the Pool's `cash` balance (see
     * `getPoolTokenInfo`).
     *
     * If the caller is not `sender`, it must be an authorized relayer for them.
     *
     * The `tokens` and `minAmountsOut` arrays must have the same length, and each entry in these indicates the minimum
     * token amount to receive for each token contract. The amounts to send are decided by the Pool and not the Vault:
     * it just enforces these minimums.
     *
     * If exiting a Pool that holds WETH, it is possible to receive ETH directly: the Vault will do the unwrapping. To
     * enable this mechanism, the IAsset sentinel value (the zero address) must be passed in the `assets` array instead
     * of the WETH address. Note that it is not possible to combine ETH and WETH in the same exit.
     *
     * `assets` must have the same length and order as the array returned by `getPoolTokens`. This prevents issues when
     * interacting with Pools that register and deregister tokens frequently. If receiving ETH however, the array must
     * be sorted *before* replacing the WETH address with the ETH sentinel value (the zero address), which means the
     * final `assets` array might not be sorted. Pools with no registered tokens cannot be exited.
     *
     * If `toInternalBalance` is true, the tokens will be deposited to `recipient`'s Internal Balance. Otherwise,
     * an ERC20 transfer will be performed. Note that ETH cannot be deposited to Internal Balance: attempting to
     * do so will trigger a revert.
     *
     * `minAmountsOut` is the minimum amount of tokens the user expects to get out of the Pool, for each token in the
     * `tokens` array. This array must match the Pool's registered tokens.
     *
     * This causes the Vault to call the `IBasePool.onExitPool` hook on the Pool's contract, where Pools implement
     * their own custom logic. This typically requires additional information from the user (such as the expected number
     * of Pool shares to return). This can be encoded in the `userData` argument, which is ignored by the Vault and
     * passed directly to the Pool's contract.

    // Swaps
    //
    // Users can swap tokens with Pools by calling the `swap` and `batchSwap` functions. To do this,
    // they need not trust Pool contracts in any way: all security checks are made by the Vault. They must however be
    // aware of the Pools' pricing algorithms in order to estimate the prices Pools will quote.
    //
    // The `swap` function executes a single swap, while `batchSwap` can perform multiple swaps in sequence.
    // In each individual swap, tokens of one kind are sent from the sender to the Pool (this is the 'token in'),
    // and tokens of another kind are sent from the Pool to the recipient in exchange (this is the 'token out').
    // More complex swaps, such as one token in to multiple tokens out can be achieved by batching together
    // individual swaps.
    //
    // There are two swap kinds:
    //  - 'given in' swaps, where the amount of tokens in (sent to the Pool) is known, and the Pool determines (via the
    // `onSwap` hook) the amount of tokens out (to send to the recipient).
    //  - 'given out' swaps, where the amount of tokens out (received from the Pool) is known, and the Pool determines
    // (via the `onSwap` hook) the amount of tokens in (to receive from the sender).
    //
    // Additionally, it is possible to chain swaps using a placeholder input amount, which the Vault replaces with
    // the calculated output of the previous swap. If the previous swap was 'given in', this will be the calculated
    // tokenOut amount. If the previous swap was 'given out', it will use the calculated tokenIn amount. These extended
    // swaps are known as 'multihop' swaps, since they 'hop' through a number of intermediate tokens before arriving at
    // the final intended token.
    //
    // In all cases, tokens are only transferred in and out of the Vault (or withdrawn from and deposited into Internal
    // Balance) after all individual swaps have been completed, and the net token balance change computed. This makes
    // certain swap patterns, such as multihops, or swaps that interact with the same token pair in multiple Pools, cost
    // much less gas than they would otherwise.
    //
    // It also means that under certain conditions it is possible to perform arbitrage by swapping with multiple
    // Pools in a way that results in net token movement out of the Vault (profit), with no tokens being sent in (only
    // updating the Pool's internal accounting).
    //
    // To protect users from front-running or the market changing rapidly, they supply a list of 'limits' for each token
    // involved in the swap, where either the maximum number of tokens to send (by passing a positive value) or the
    // minimum amount of tokens to receive (by passing a negative value) is specified.
    //
    // Additionally, a 'deadline' timestamp can also be provided, forcing the swap to fail if it occurs after
    // this point in time (e.g. if the transaction failed to be included in a block promptly).
    //
    // If interacting with Pools that hold WETH, it is possible to both send and receive ETH directly: the Vault will do
    // the wrapping and unwrapping. To enable this mechanism, the IAsset sentinel value (the zero address) must be
    // passed in the `assets` array instead of the WETH address. Note that it is possible to combine ETH and WETH in the
    // same swap. Any excess ETH will be sent back to the caller (not the sender, which is relevant for relayers).
    //
    // Finally, Internal Balance can be used when either sending or receiving tokens.

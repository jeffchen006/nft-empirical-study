/**
  @title A contract for minting ERC-721 items given an ERC-20 token burn and
    ownership of some prerequisite ERC-721 items.
  @author 0xthrpw
  @author Tim Clancy

  This contract allows for the configuration of multiple redemption rounds. Each
  redemption round is configured with a set of ERC-721 item collection addresses
  in the `redemptionCriteria` mapping that any prospective redeemers must hold.

  Each redemption round is also configured with a redemption configuration per
  the `redemptionConfigs` mapping. This configuration allows a caller holding
  the required ERC-721 items to mint some amount `amountOut` of a new ERC-721
  `tokenOut` item in exchange for burning `price` amount of a `payingToken`
  ERC-20 token.

  Any ERC-721 collection being minted by this redeemer must grant minting
  permissions to this contract in some fashion. Users must also approve this
  contract to spend any requisite `payingToken` ERC-20 tokens on their behalf.

  Compared to the original `Super721` implementation that this contract forked
  from, this is a very pared-down contract that includes simple delegated
  minting and transfer locks.

  This contract includes the gas efficiency techniques graciously shared with
  the world in the specific ERC-721 implementation by Chiru Labs that is being
  called "ERC-721A" (https://github.com/chiru-labs/ERC721A). We have validated
  this contract against their test cases.

    This function allows permissioned minters of this contract to mint one or

    to the `_recipient` address.

    the list of token IDs is always increasing and looks like [ 1, 2, 3... ].
    Also note that per our use cases the intended recipient of these minted
    items will always be externally-owned accounts and not other contracts. As a
    result there is no safety check on whether or not the mint destination can
    actually correctly handle an ERC-721 token.

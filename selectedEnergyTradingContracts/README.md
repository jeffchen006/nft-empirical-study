Here we explore the common functions across these selected energy trading contracts already deployed 


The following is the list of common functions across the selected energy trading contracts:

As we can see, approve/transferFrom/transfer/approveAndCall/burn/burnFrom are typical ERC operations
addPauser/pause/unpause are typical Pausable operations
burn/burnFrom/transferOwnership are typical Ownable operations

the rest of the functions are specific to the energy trading domain

But I believe they are not enough to be considered as a common pattern across the selected energy trading contracts.
